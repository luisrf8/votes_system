Data
This project uses an array of objects to store the data. The users array includes a list of users with their ID, username, password, and some statistics. The sessions array includes a list of sessions with their ID, user ID, start time, button clicked, and some statistics. The clicks array includes a list of button clicks with their ID, session ID, button clicked, and time. All arrays are initially empty and are updated through the API endpoints.
